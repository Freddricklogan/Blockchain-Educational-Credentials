## System Architecture
![System Architecture Diagram](images/system_architecture.jpg)

### Core Components
- **Blockchain Network**: Ethereum-based distributed ledger
- **Smart Contracts**: Credential issuance and verification logic
- **IPFS Storage**: Decentralized document storage
- **Web Applications**: Administrative and user interfaces

### Integration Points
- Student Information System (SIS)
- Learning Management System (LMS)
- Identity Management System
- Alumni/Career Services Portal

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Planning (6-8 weeks)
- Stakeholder identification and engagement
- Requirements analysis and system design
- Security and privacy assessment
- Policy framework development

### Phase 2: Development (10-12 weeks)
- Smart contract development and auditing
- Administrative interface implementation
- Student wallet development
- Integration adapters for existing systems

### Phase 3: Pilot (6-8 weeks)
- Deployment with select departments
- Controlled credential issuance
- User feedback collection
- System refinement

### Phase 4: Full Deployment (8-10 weeks)
- Organization-wide rollout
- Staff training program
- Student onboarding
- Support system establishment

## Security Framework

### Key Management
- Multi-signature institutional wallets
- Hardware security module integration
- Key recovery protocols
- Access control systems

### Privacy Controls
- Zero-knowledge proofs for verification
- Selective disclosure mechanisms
- Compliance with FERPA/GDPR
- Data minimization practices

### Audit Systems
- Comprehensive event logging
- Automated compliance monitoring
- Regular security assessments
- Penetration testing schedule

## Integration Strategies
